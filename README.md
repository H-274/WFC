Small wave function collapse algorithm implementation

__HOW TO:__

Just run the "generate_image.py" file with pyton 3.9 installed on your system.

__Customization:__

Add your own tileset and make a json file, using the existing one as reference.
From there, modify the parser's path in "generate_image.py" and you'll be golden!
