# WFC
Small wave function collapse algorithm implementation

__HOW TO:__

1. Make sure you have the PIL library in your python environment with its required dependencies.

2. Run the "generate_image.py" file with pyton 3.9.

__Customization:__

Add your own tileset and make a json file, using the existing one as reference.
From there, modify the parser's path in "generate_image.py" and you'll be golden!
